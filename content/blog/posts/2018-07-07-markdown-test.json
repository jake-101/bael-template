  "body": "# An h1 header\n\nParagraphs are separated by a blank line.\n\n2nd paragraph. _Italic_, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists\nlook like:\n\n* this one\n* that one\n* the other one\n\nNote that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text\ncontent starts at 4-columns in.\n\n> Block quotes are\n> written like so.\n>\n> They can span multiple paragraphs,\n> if you like.\n\nUse 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., \"it's all\nin chapters 12--14\"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.\nUnicode is supported. ☺\n\n## An h2 header\n\nHere's a numbered list:\n\n1. first item\n2. second item\n3. third item\n\nNote again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters\nfrom the left side). Here's a code sample:\n\n```\n# Let me re-iterate ...\nfor i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }\n```\n\nAs you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of\nindenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:\n\n```\ndefine foobar() {\n    print \"Welcome to flavor country!\";\n}\n```\n\n(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the\ndelimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:\n\n```python\nimport time\n# Quick, count to ten!\nfor i in range(10):\n    # (but not *too* quick)\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    print i\n```\n\n### An h3 header\n\nNow a nested list:\n\n1. First, get these ingredients:\n   * carrots\n   * celery\n   * lentils\n2. Boil some water.\n3. Dump everything in the pot and follow\n   this algorithm:\n   ```\n   find wooden spoon\n   uncover pot\n   stir\n   cover pot\n   balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle\n   wait 10 minutes\n   goto first step (or shut off burner when done)\n   ```\n   Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.\n\nNotice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including\nthat last line which continues item 3 above).\n\nHere's a link to [a website](http://foo.bar), to a [local\ndoc](local-doc.html), and to a [section heading in the current\ndoc](#an-h2-header). Here's a footnote \\[^1].\n\n\\[^1]: Footnote text goes here.\n\nTables can look like this:\n\nsize  material      color\n\n- - -\n\n9     leather       brown\n10    hemp canvas   natural\n11    glass         transparent\n\nTable: Shoes, their sizes, and what they're made of\n\n(The above is the caption for the table.) Pandoc also supports\nmulti-line tables:\n\n- - -\n\nkeyword   text\n\n- - -\n\nred       Sunsets, apples, and\n          other red or reddish\n          things.\n\ngreen     Leaves, grass, frogs\n          and other things it's\n          not easy being.\n\n- - -\n\nA horizontal rule follows.\n\n- - -\n\nHere's a definition list:\n\napples\n  : Good for making applesauce.\noranges\n  : Citrus!\ntomatoes\n  : There's no \"e\" in tomatoe.\n\nAgain, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each\nterm/definition pair to spread things out more.)\n\nHere's a \"line block\":\n\n\\| Line one\n|   Line too\n| Line tree\n\nand images can be specified like so:\n\n![example image](/images/uploads/14th-factory-collage.jpg)\n\nInline math equations go in like so: $\\omega = d\\phi / dt$. Display\nmath should get its own line and be put in in double-dollarsigns:\n\n$$I = \\int \\rho R^{2} dV$$\n\nAnd note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters\nwhich you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \\`foo\\`, \\*bar\\*, etc."
